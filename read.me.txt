Next we have to install our dependencies, first make sure you have the latest version of pip, then run pip install -r requirements.txt
to download the frozen dependencies contained in requirements.txt

You can confirm installation with pip list

Afterward you can access method calling through Main.py where you can run our application

Simultaneously you can host a local server with command: python manage.py runserver 
and view the User Interface provided as well as access the functions called.
